00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:20.893
All the things you said to me

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:25.127
I felt like butter in the heat

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:27.112
(in the heat)

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.059
When I close my eyes

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.359
(close my eyes)

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.228
It gets dark,

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.229
but it's nice

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:38.137
(it's nice)

00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:43.522
All the things you said to me

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.000
I felt like butter in the heat

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
(in the heat)

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.607
When I close my eyes

00:00:53.607 --> 00:00:55.055
(close my eyes)

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.080
It gets dark,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.068
but it's nice

00:01:00.068 --> 00:01:00.984
(it's nice)

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:05.364
If the sun doesn't shine

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.472
(doesn't shine)

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:11.594
The moon will soon rise

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:13.046
(rise)

00:01:13.488 --> 00:01:16.678
If the sun doesn't shine

00:01:16.678 --> 00:01:17.770
(doesn't shine)

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:23.046
The moon will soon rise

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:27.243
If the sun...

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:28.270
(sun)

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:33.089
...doesn't shine

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:35.308
(shine)

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:49.312
Someday I realise

00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:50.476
(-ise)

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:56.037
Silence can bring surprises

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.564
Time travels in my mind

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:06.956
Time travels in my mind

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:12.866
Time travels in my mind

00:02:13.452 --> 00:02:18.640
Time travels in my mind

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.808
Time travels in my mi—

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:53.414
And if I see you in my life

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:04.336
There's no need to pretend

00:03:08.953 --> 00:03:16.685
Remember when you knocked on my door?

00:03:20.172 --> 00:03:29.042
[Saying] "I think I lost your love"

00:04:06.387 --> 00:04:07.833
(Don't fall)

00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:11.268
(Don't fall all apart)

00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:13.370
(It's too late)

00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:16.769
(We're heading different ways now)

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:19.348
Don't fall

00:04:19.914 --> 00:04:22.731
Don't fall all apart

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.920
It's too late

00:04:25.154 --> 00:04:28.361
We're heading different ways now

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.683
Don't fall

00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:34.169
Don't fall all apart

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:36.418
It's too late

00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:39.922
We're heading different ways now

00:04:39.922 --> 00:04:42.191
Don't fall

00:04:42.796 --> 00:04:45.560
Don't fall all apart

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:47.763
It's too late

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:53.331
We're heading different ways now

00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:56.451
(Don't fall all apart)

00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:59.954
Now

00:05:02.872 --> 00:05:04.872
Don't fall

00:05:05.808 --> 00:05:08.329
Don't fall all apart

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.602
It's too late

00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:14.129
We're heading different ways now

00:05:14.307 --> 00:05:16.698
Don't fall

00:05:17.257 --> 00:05:19.891
Don't fall all apart

00:05:20.138 --> 00:05:22.112
It's too late

00:05:22.534 --> 00:05:24.777
We're heading different ways—
