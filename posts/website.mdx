Good riddance, I am so glad to be finally call this website finished.
I started working on this site about 2 years ago, since then I've had the joy of rewriting the entire site from scrach twice.

Everything you see on this site was made by me. This is my little corner of the internet. Welcome.

## First version: Plain ol' HTML+CSS+JS

Initially, the site started out as a plain simple HTML+CSS+JS site (which I'll call vanilla web dev or just vanilla from now on). I liked the simplicity of making a vanilla site without any of that other web dev stuff which I, primarily as a C++ programmer, intrinsically hate.

Eventually, I realised I wanted a site that in practice was a blog that I'd use to share production notes on my projects as well as high quality downloads. As it turns out, pagination isn't easy to implement in a vanilla site.

I also realised I had no idea how I was going to host the site, ideally on GitHub Pages. That was the final nail in the coffin.

## Second version: Jekyll

So in light of issues presented with vanilla web dev (turns out web dev nowadays isn't very friendly to vanilla enjoyers like me), I switched to making a Jekyll site.

I stuck with Jekyll for a good year or so, and I made good progress during that time, coming close to a production site.
