### Header links

All headers automatically have a link button next to them. You can link to a header by clicking the link button.

For example `#header-links` will link to the header above. You can link to it using the regular markdown link syntax and the the header id as the url. So you can link to the above header with [#header-links](#header-links).

You can link to a header on another page too, like the `#second-version-jekyll` header on the `project/website` page. So, you can link to it with [/project/website#second-version-jekyll](/project/website#second-version-jekyll).
